IT IS NOT PRIME NUMBER ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PRIME FACTOR 

Following are the steps to find all prime factors.
1) While n is divisible by 2, print 2 and divide n by 2.
2) After step 1, n must be odd. Now start a loop from i = 3 to square root of n. While i divides n, print i and divide n by i, increment i by 2 and continue.
3) If n is a prime number and is greater than 2, then n will not become 1 by above two steps. So print n if it is greater than 2.





#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	//code
	int t,i,j;
	long long int n,max;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    cin>>n;
	    while(n%2==0)
	    {
	        max=2;
	        n=n/2;
	    }
	    for(i=3;i<=sqrt(n);i=i+2)
	    {
    	       while(n%i==0)
    	       {
    	        max=i;
    	        n=n/i;
    	       }
	    }
	    if(n>2)
	     max =n;
	     
	     cout<<max<<endl;
	     
	}
	return 0;
}
